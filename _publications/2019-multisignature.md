A multi signature scheme allows a group of signers to produce a joint signature on a common message, which is more compact than a collection of distinct signatures from all signers. Given this signature and the list of signers' public keys, a verifier is able to check if every signer in the group participated in signing. Recently, a multisignature scheme with public key aggregation has drawn a lot of attention due to their applications into the blockchain technology. Such multisignatures provide not only a compact signature, but also a compact aggregated public key, that is both the signature size and the public key size used to verify the correctness of the signature are independent from the number of signers. This is useful for a blockchain because of its duplication over a distributed network, and thus it is required to be as compact as possible. In this paper, we introduce a new multisignature scheme with such a feature. Our scheme is proven secure under the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption. In addition, in the presence of rogue key attacks, the security of our scheme is proven in the plain public key model.
