Blockchain technology is already being explored in a wide number of Fintech sectors. This talk will present an overview of the Fintech ecosystem and the topics that can be investigated as a result of the new digital advances brought forth by blockchain. We will first present the fundamentals of blockchain, and then how blockchain technology transforms the Fintech industry. Based on a list of selected characteristics, we will present a taxonomy of blockchain platforms.
