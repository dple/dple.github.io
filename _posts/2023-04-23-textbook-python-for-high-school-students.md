Well, when my kid went to the high school level, he starting feel boring with Scratch, so I was looking something that can inspire him a further step to the coding world. C/C++ seems require too much tech passion from the kids, Java is probably a good consideration if you are a computer science university student, by perhaps not for a high school student. I found that Python could be the best choice as its simplicity and its conciseness. 


You may find many books or online resources that teach Python to beginners. As I could not find any single source that balances coding and problem-solving at the high school level, I decided to ‘collect’ from many sources (some of them are mentioned in the reference section below) and organize them in this textbook. Of course, the balance I mentioned here is just my personal view, and you may not need to agree with that. If you, by any chance, are reading this book, I hope you enjoy and find it helpful for your study.
