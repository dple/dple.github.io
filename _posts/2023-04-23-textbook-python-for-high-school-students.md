This textbook is prepared for high school students who want to learn to code and solve problems with Python. You may find many books or online resources that teach Python to beginners. As I could not find any single source that balances coding and problem-solving at the high school level, I decided to ‘collect’ from many sources (some of them are mentioned in the reference section below) and gather them in this textbook. Of course, the balance I mentioned here is just my personal view, and you may not need to agree with that. If you, by any chance, are reading this book, I hope you enjoy and find it helpful for your study.
