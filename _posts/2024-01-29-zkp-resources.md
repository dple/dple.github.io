Zero-Kowledge Proof (ZKP) probably is currently the hottest topic in the cryptography world. The idea of proving `something is true without revealing any information apart from the fact that this specific statement is true` is one of the most beautiful thing that cryptography could do.

Although the [ZP concept](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/shafi/1985-stoc.pdf) was introduced long time ago by MIT researchers Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali and Charles Rackoff, it was just becoming more practical recently and yields a huge potential in Web3. 

From my experience, I found that it is hard to understand Zero-knowledge through academic papers. If you want, I think the most comprehensive explanation trying to illustrate this concept was probably written by Matthew Green in his blog and and [Youtube video] by Avi Wigderson:

- [Zero Knowledge Proofs: An illustrated primer](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/27/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer/), written by Matthew Green.
- [Zero Knowledge Proof - Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ovdoxnfFVc&ab_channel=Numberphile2), given by Avi Wigderson.

Then, there are very good video lectures that summarize the development of zero-knowledge proof schemes:

- [Bilinear Pairings-based Zero-Knowledge Proofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-z3JYlFdzs&ab_channel=ZKProofStandards), given by Jens Groth.
- [Overview of Modern SNARK Constructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGEXYpt3sj0&ab_channel=Blockchain-Web3MOOCs), given by Dan Boneh.
